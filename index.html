            Hi everyone! My name is Mickey and I am excited to be in ART101 this semester. I love art and creating things,
            so I am looking forward to learning more about web design and how to make my own website. In my free time, I
            enjoy painting, drawing, and crafting. I also love playing video games and watching TV shows like Below Deck.
            When I'm not doing those things, I like to hang out with my cats and my boyfriend. I have four siblings, so
            family is very important to me. Overall, I'm really excited to be a part of this class and can't wait to see
            what we will create together!
        </p>
